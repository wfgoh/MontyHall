# Monty Hall
**Simulation of the Monty Hall Problem**

**Introduction**</br>
The Monte Hall problem is loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall.

**The Monte Hall Problem**</br>
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</br>

No change after door opened: 33 wins over 100 times
Probability = 0.33
Change after door opened: 67 wins over 100 times
Probability = 0.67
Random guess after door opened: 54 wins over 100 times
Probability = 0.54
